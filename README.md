🏎️ F1 Top 5 Decision Trees
📌 Project Overview

This mini-project uses Decision Tree Classifiers from scikit-learn to predict whether a Formula 1 driver will finish in the Top 5 based on given race data. The goal is to explore machine learning classification, understand decision boundaries, and visualize how decision trees make predictions.

🚀 Features

🏁 Driver Performance Prediction – Classifies if a driver finishes in Top 5.

🌳 Decision Tree Visualization – Clearly see how splits are made on features.

📊 Accuracy & Metrics – Evaluate model performance with precision, recall, and accuracy.

🔧 Customizable Data – Can be easily extended with more features like weather, team, circuit type, etc.

🧠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – Data handling

numpy – Numerical operations

scikit-learn – Model training and visualization

matplotlib – Plotting decision trees and results

📸 Sample Output

(Optional: You can add a screenshot of the decision tree or confusion matrix here.)

🔮 Future Scope

Add Random Forest and compare results.

Use real-world F1 datasets (from Ergast API or Kaggle).

Deploy as a simple web app (Streamlit or Flask).

🏆 Why This Project?

Because F1 + Data Science = Fast, Fun & Fantastic Learning! 🏎️💨
